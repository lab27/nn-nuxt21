        h3 Introduction
        p White Risk is a comprehensive online educational portal and toolset dedicated to avalanche safety and prevention. Adapting the definitive book by experts from the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, my team and I spent two years developing original architecture and visuals for the project, winning a Horizon Interactive Gold Award in the process.

          figcaption In this larger rendering of one of the chapter-navigation mountains, you can see the attention to detail in the snow patterns, the ski tracks, the small buildings and trees, even the translucent cloud. Each feature of the mountain represents a separate section of the chapter.

          figcaption Among the portal's five chapters of content, I created hundreds of infographics and visual tools such as this one, including icons, charts, graphs, 2D and 3D illustrations.

          figcaption Another example of a complex visualization of a snowpack. The use of a subdued blue-gray palette for the UI allows the bright red and yellow colors to stand out as the most important data points.
