          figcaption My logo design for the company. The hand-drawn wing represents the sense of liberation that comes with unshackling oneself from addiction. The artisanal quality of the shape is meant to evoke the boutique nature of the clinic and underscore the personal, human experience at the heart of Plan Your Recovery's work.

          figcaption In addition to eliciting a sense of trust for visitors to the site, it was important to create a mood of warmth, hospitality and health through the use of color, typography and a minimalist, spacious layout, giving the content plenty of room to breathe.

          figcaption The content on the site is very informative, and the language is gentle and reassuring because it reflects the generous spirit of its founder and practitioners. I chose a design approach that would provide a simple frame for the words and ideas, rendering them legible and attractive, and staying out of their way.
