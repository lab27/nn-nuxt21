        h3 Introduction
        p Craft Music is a family-owned and operated Los Angeles-based music instrument school. The asked me for advice about expanding their remote-learning offerings, so I put together a quick prototype demonstrating how their website could be enhanced to encourage visitors to sign up for lessons on the spot.

          figcaption In this screen from the Energy Data module of the customer portal, you can see my intention to break out of the conventional "boxy" look of most business dashboard applications. This design aligns with Axpo's corporate identity, which leans heavily on mid-centry Swiss principles of grid, spacing and typographical constrast. With this approach, we remind our customers that they're using a tool which is tailor-made for them, not just a pre-packaged solution.

          figcaption One of the challenges of this project has been to summarize large collections of data in visual way that give the user access to the most relevant information while keeping them from feeling overwhelmed. In this design, for example, the user sees more detailed hedging data when hovering the card.

          img(src="/img/axpo/pricer.jpg")
          figcaption In this screen from a comprehensive prototype of an energy pricing tool I designed, the user uploads historical consumption data to a pricing "object." The tool queries an up-to-date pricing curve every 15minutes, refreshing the price.

          img(src="/img/axpo/binding-price.jpg")
          figcaption When the user requests a firm price offer, the pricing card enters "offer" mode and takes on a new visual appearance. I led the discovery phase of the project, interviewed all stakeholders and designed the prototype based on several rounds of tests with real customers.

          figcaption Amidst the data-intensive UI designs, it is refreshing to occasionally design a visually engaging langing page.

          figcaption In addition to UX & UI design and prototyping, I am often called upon to create marketing and informational videos, for example "how-to" videos and feature-release announcements.
