       h4 Voice Republic was a platform for high-quality spoken content, with headquarters in ZÃ¼rich and Berlin. It offered conferences, lecture series, book fairs and individual podcasters an easy way to live-stream their content. Notable appearances included Edward Snowden, Slawoj Zizek and Angela Merkel. As Head of Product Design on a small team, I redesigned the product and implemented much of the front-end code myself.
